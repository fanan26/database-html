	A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically<br /> from a computer system.<br /> 
	Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.<br />
	
The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, <br />applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.<br />

 The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database.<br />
 The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system".<br />
 Often the term "database" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, <br />the database system or an application associated with the database.
<br />
Computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support.<br />
 Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s.<br /> 
 These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use <br />SQL for writing and querying data. <br />
 In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as NoSQL <br />because they use different query languages.
