	The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs <br />have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were <br />enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors, computer memory, <br />computer storage, and computer networks. <br />The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access <br />storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid 1960s; <br />earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape.<br />The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three <br />eras based on data model or structure: navigational, SQL/relational, and post-relational.<br />

The two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model <br />and the CODASYL model (network model).<br /> These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) <br />to follow relationships from one record to another.<br /><br />

The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, <br />departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should <br />search for data by content, rather than by following links. <br />The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. <br />Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough <br />to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). <br />By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing <br />applications, and as of 2018 they remain dominant: IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, <br />and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS. <br />The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, <br />has influenced database languages for other data models.<br />

Object databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience <br />of object–relational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term <br />"post-relational" and also the development of hybrid object–relational databases.<br /><br />

The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as<br />NoSQL databases, introducing fast key–value stores and document-oriented databases. <br />A competing "next generation" known as NewSQL databases attempted new <br />implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match <br />the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.
